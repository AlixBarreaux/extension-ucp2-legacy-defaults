# UCP2-Legacy Default Settings
These are the settings you've learned to love and enjoy with UCP 2.15b, now with some added features from the former development branch. Please note: If you wish to enable specific settings, such as the running spearmen or spectator mode, we recommend further customizing these default settings as your starting point.
The added default settings compared to UCP 2.15b include:
- Smarter housing management
- Disabled sleep mode for production facilities
- Improved restocking of necessary goods
- Quality of Life (QoL) options and bug fixes, for example, adding rapid building placements for common buildings like houses and woodcutters
- Integration of the fixed AI vanilla castles and behavior patches
